# Code Countdown Timer
### Python tip:

There is a simple way to create a code countdown timer using the perf_counter() class from the time module. I wrote a function that demonstrates how you can use it as a performance counter for your code. perf_counter() returns how long it takes to create a list from a range using a for loop.
